# Western Elevator
Hold your horses and beware the elevator system from the wild west! It is powerd by 15 horses driving a huge horsemill. The local Sheriff is orchestarting all of it with good help from his Wranglers who are ready to step in at any time.

## Getting Started
The elevator system can be run out of the box with go run main.go. The system is by default configured to be run with three elevators with 4 floors.

## Config file
To further customize the elevatorsystem for your needs, please modify config.go
